# INFO5100
Repository for final project of INFO 5100-Application Engineering and Development

A business portal to get instant access to reliable and affordable services at your
doorstep.

The project has two facets. Professionals can register themselves for the service they
will be providing. Customer can view available services and order a service at their doorstep.
There will be several categories from which the user can select the service which he/she
wants to order. According to pricing of the service, a final bill will be generated.

The project is a marketplace for local services. There is dearth of a
single platform available for people where they can order any service for themselves from
yoga trainers to plumbers. Our project will solve this challenging problem of providing a
single platform for services across various domains.
